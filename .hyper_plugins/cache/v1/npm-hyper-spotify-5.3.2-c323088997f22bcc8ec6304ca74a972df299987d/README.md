## Installation
Simply add this plugin inside `~/.hyper.js` and enjoy your music :musical_note:
```js
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: ['hyper-spotify']
  ...
}
```

<br />

## Configuration
In your `~/.hyper.js` you can define the following parameters to customize `hyper-spotify` appearance
```js
modules.exports = {
  config: {
    ...
    hyperSpotify: {
      position: 'top', // or 'bottom'
      margin: 'default', // or 'double' or custom value
      controlsPosition: 'default', // or 'left' or 'right'
    },
    ...
  },
  ... 
};
```

### Position
`hyper-spotify bar` supports 2 different positioning: 
- `top`
- `bottom` (default)

### Margin
`hyper-spotify bar` supports 3 margin options:
- `default`, should work most of the times
- `double`, when using other bar plugins (such as `hyper-statusline` or `hyperline`)
- custom value, specify a custom margin value as an interger (e.g. 30)

### Controls position
`hyper-spotify controls` support 3 different positioning: 
- `default`, controls appears just before the song details
- `left`, controls are fixed to the left side of Hyper window
- `right`, controls are fixed to the right side of Hyper window

### Theme
`hyper-spotify` support different themes:
- `default`, A light theme with a `Spotify Green` (`#1ED760`) Spotify icon
- `light`, An white theme suitable for dark `hyper` themes
- `dark`, A deep-black theme suitable for light `hyper` themes
- special event themes (look for them if you really want to :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
- `custom`, A customizable theme (see below for more options)

#### Custom Theme
If you'd like to give a personal touch to `hyper-spotify`, you can use a custom `theme` and specify one or more of the theme colors
- `overlayColor`, the color to apply to `hyper-spotify` bar background, defaults to `white` (`#FFF`)
- `iconColor`, the color for every actionable icon, defaults to `white` (`#FFF`)
- `spotifyIconColor`, the color for the Spotify icon (visible when `Spotify` app is not running), defaults to `iconColor` (if specified) or to `Spotify Green` (`#1ED760`)
- `textColor`, track info color, defaults to `white` (`#FFF`)

<br />

Custom theme sample configuration, edit your `~/.hyper.js`
```js
modules.exports = {
  config: {
    ...
    hyperSpotify: {
      ...
      theme: 'custom', // important!
      overlayColor: '#000',
      iconColor: '#D75C1B',
      spotifyIconColor: '#1ED760',
      textColor: '#FFF'
    },
    ...
  },
  ... 
};
```

<br />

## Hotkeys
The following hotkeys to control Spotify are enabled when Hyper terminal is focused:
- Play/Pause: `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+Space`
- Next song: `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+N`
- Previous song: `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+P`

<br />

## Limitations
Currently works only on `macOS`, `Linux` (Tested on Ubuntu 17.04).

## Troubleshooting

### Can't load `hyper-spotify`
Unfortunately this seems to be a common issue with `Hyper` plugins (see here [zeit/hyper#191](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/191))

After installing `hyper-spotify` if `Hyper`Â complains about an error while enabling the plugin:
- do a full restart of `Hyper` app

if even after restaring the issue persists try running the following command
```bash
$ cd ~/.hyper_plugins && npm install
```

### `abstract-socket` module error
If you get an error related to `abstract-socket` not being compiled with the correct Node version, you can try the following solution:
- Retrieve `Hyper` electron version by running `process.versions.electron` inside Hyper DevTools console
- Run `~/.hyper_plugins/node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild -v [output of process.versions.electron]` inside the terminal

For more details see [issue #13](https://github.com/panz3r/hyper-spotify/issues/13#issuecomment-453855958).

### Issue with `hyper-statusline`

If you have issue using this plugin alongside `hyper-statusline` make sure this plugin is declared before `hyper-statusline`.

## Credits

This plugin is inspired by [`atom-spotify2`](https://github.com/albertorestifo/atom-spotify2) and relies on 
[`spotify-js`](https://github.com/panz3r/spotify-js) to interact with [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) client
